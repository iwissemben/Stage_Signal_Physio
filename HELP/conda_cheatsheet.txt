To deactivate an env: conda deactivate
To list the environnements : conda info --envs

To create a new environnement: conda create -n wissem_venv python=3.11.3

To activate an environnement: conda activate wissem_venv

To delete an environnement and its packages : conda remove --name wissem_venv --all
To delete a package: conda remove package-name

To install a specific version of python in an environement:  conda install python=3.11.3


To export an environnement:
- 1 - Activate the env to export: conda activate wissem_venv
- 2 - Export as yml file:
	- A - (to export all packages and additional libraries that solve for dependencies - with build versions)
		- conda env export > ./HELP/environnement/wissem_venv_ex.yml 
	- B - (to export all libraries and dependencies - without build versions)
		- conda env export --no-builds > ./HELP/environnement/wissem_venv_nb.yml 
	- C - (to export only explicitly installed libraries - without build versions)
		-conda env export --from-history > ./HELP/environnement/wissem_venv.yml
- 3 - Create environement from yaml file:
	- conda env create -f ./HELP/environnement/wissem_venv.yml
- 4 - Activate the newly created environnement:
	- conda activate wissem_venv

Note 1: The environement name and its python version can be found in the yml file.

Note 2: Only method 2-C for exportation allows replication of the environement both on macOS and windows.

Note 3: Method 2-C Ignores the required downloading channels, must be added mannualy or else gives error "resolvepackagenotfound".

Note 4: Tested on macos High Sierra vm, with VSCode and Anaconda. The .py scripts works, issues running jupyter notebooks (due to GPU configuration missing)
