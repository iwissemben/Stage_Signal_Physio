Settings help for VS Code
-If we want to use filepaths relative to current workspace instead of the considered script to run on interactive mode correctly , On VS code go to settings, search "jupyter file root", and change the file root: ${fileDirname}" to "${workspaceRoot}"
-If plots rendered inside jupyter's cells aren't zoomable add '%matplotlib widget' line at the begining of the notebook. Eventually install the library 'ipympl' V.0.9.0.
