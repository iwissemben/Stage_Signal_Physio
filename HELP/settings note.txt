Settings help for VS Code:

-Make sure to have the same working directory in terminal and vscode interractive mode. To use the root folder as reference:
	-go to user settings, search for "python.terminal.executeInFileDir".
	-Uncheck "exectue in file dir"

-If we want to use filepaths relative to current workspace instead of the considered script to run on interactive mode correctly , 
	-On VS code go to settings, 
	-search "jupyter file root" 
	-and change the file root: ${fileDirname}" to "${workspaceRoot}"
-If plots rendered inside jupyter's cells aren't zoomable add '%matplotlib widget' line at the begining of the notebook. Eventually install the library 'ipympl' V.0.9.0.
